Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of programming and is used for objects that involves grouping 
the data (I mean variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single 
unit, called a class. The cool thing about this is that behind encapsulation is to restrict direct 
access to some of the components of an object, which helps to avoid unwanted interference and misuse 
of the data. Instead, the class provides public methods that are either accessor methods or setter 
or getter methods to safely interact with the private data.

A key benefit of encapsulation is that it helps protect the internal state of an object, and that makes 
the object's data only modified in a controlled manner. This makes the code easier to maintain, reduces 
bugs, and improves security by hiding implementation details.

In my program, the Word class demonstrates encapsulation well. The Text property is private, so it can 
only be accessed and modified through the Word class's methods. Here's an example:

      public class Word
      {
          public string Text { get; private set; }
          public bool IsHidden { get; private set; }

          public Word(string text)
          {
              Text = text;
              IsHidden = false;
          }

          public void Hide()
          {
              IsHidden = true;
          }

          public string GetDisplayText()
          {
              return IsHidden ? new string('_', Text.Length) : Text;
          }
      }

In this example, the Text property is read-only outside the class. The Hide method allows the IsHidden 
state to be modified, but it is the class itself that controls how the state changes. This protects the 
internal state of the Word object and ensures that the IsHidden flag is only updated by the appropriate 
method. This encapsulation simplifies debugging, makes the code safer, and ensures that the data is used 
correctly throughout the program.
